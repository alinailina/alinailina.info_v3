          My name is Alina Ilina. Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer and UI Imagineer, a

          , as
          <span>
            I believe user interfaces <span>tell a story</span>, and nothing is
            more important to a good narrative than imagination .
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          I combine my passion for user interface design and development to help
          brands create digital experiences for a long-lasting emotional
          connection with their audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My strong interests in usability and interaction design inform my work
          as a Developer. I believe less is more and strive for depth through
          simplicity &mdash; making everything obvinpm startous or
          self-explanatory is my ultimate goal as a Developer and a Human.

          An expert in the making, I occasionally write about things I learn{" "}

          When I'm not writing code, I like to do strength training exercises,
          listen to podcasts and watch popular science documentaries.
